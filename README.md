# Battery-Charger-UI-Interface
This project implements the UI for a DC Rectifier/Battery Charger system. It allows users to configure parameters like voltage, current, and power via an LCD screen and buttons. User input is stored using flash memory with EEPROM emulation, ensuring settings are retained after power cycles for a smooth user experience.
